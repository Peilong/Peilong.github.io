Students are responsible for all content covered in class as well as assigned book chapters. Students should come to class with their text books, having read the material to be covered that day. Students who have not prepared for class may be asked to leave.\nExcept in the case of documented emergencies, neither exams nor in-class labs can be made up afterwards. For excused absences, students must arrange to take the exam or do the lab before the normally scheduled time. Arrangements must be made with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the scheduled time.\nStudents are expected to maintain an attitude of respect at all times toward their colleagues, the equipment, and the instructor. Students are expected to refrain from using the computers for non-course related purposes during class time and will be penalized 1% of the final grade for each occurrence. Cell phones and similar devices should be turned off before entering the classroom.

If circumstances render either of these makeup policies unreasonable, the instructor will send an e-mail explaining an alternative makeup opportunity to each student’s Elizabethtown e-mail account.\nStatement on Plagiarism Please refer to the Student Handbook for the college’s policy. All projects and assignments must be completed by students individually, without assistance from anyone other than the instructor. Students can discuss the course material with each other at a conceptual level, but each student must do his or her own work. For projects, exams, and all other activities in the course, students are expected to act according to the official policy on academic dishonesty and the highest standards of personal integrity.\nThe first infraction of academic honesty in this course will carry a penalty of a 0 for the project, lab, or exam in question and a reduction of a full letter grade in the final grade. If a second infraction occurs, the students involved will fail the course, and the instructor will seek the maximum penalty possible under the college’s regulations, up to and including expulsion.\nStatement on Disability Elizabethtown College welcomes otherwise qualified students with disabilities to participate in all of its courses, programs, services, and activities. If you have a documented disability and would like to request accommodations in order to access course material, activities, or requirements, please contact the Director of Disability Services, Lynne Davies, by phone (361-1227) or e-mail daviesl@etown.edu. If your documentation meets the college’s documentation guidelines, you will be given a letter from Disability Services for each of your professors. Students experiencing certain documented temporary conditions, such as post-concussive symptoms, may also qualify for temporary academic accommodations and adjustments.

As part of the final grade of this course, students are required to read one to two technical papers from the provided paper list (or other papers agreed by the instructor), and present the paper during the last week of class. The grading of the paper presentation consists of 50% from peers and 50% from the instructor. The evaluation rubrics will be provided via Canvas.\nFinal Project The final project best demonstrates students’ understanding of the lecture contents and their capability of solving real data science problems. Students are encouraged to form teams of no more than 2 people. Solo projects are also allowed if having good reasons. Topics of the final project are left open for the teams to find, but the final choice has to be decided upon the instructor’s agreement. A good list of potential projects can be found at Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and here: https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets. Teams are responsible for finding the project of their interest and discussing the project feasibility face-to-face with the project manager, a.k.a., the instructor 1 week before the project proposal is due. Project formation is on a rolling basis, meaning formerly finalized projects cannot be taken again by another team. The grading of the final project consists of four major aspects:\n 10%: the project proposal (including the conversation with the instructor a week before due); 10%: mid-term project check (must have shown substantial exploratory data analysis); 40%: the project demonstration; code and slides are due the night before the presentation day; 40%: everything including report; revised code and the report are due on Friday of the final week.  The requirements and grading rubric for each component of the project will be posted on Canvas. Under no circumstances should any student copy the code from an outside source. Source code similarity tools will be used to detect plagiarism.\nNote:\nThere is a potential pitfall of using open datasets to introduce data science that some students want to leverage. I want to be crystal clear that the point of this project is to learn as much as possible. The point of this project is not to achieve the most intriguing results on the Kaggle leaderboard. For instance, if you copied some code you didn't understand and used it to get very compelling analytical results, I would consider this a very poor project. However, if you thoughtfully try various strategies, incorporate lots of interesting learning resources, and do a good job communicating with your peers regarding what worked and what didn't, I would consider that highly successful even if your results were not the best.\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"9098ee66b9e66d1268ae9c16ec7ea2f9","permalink":"https://Peilong.github.io/courses/ds200/grading/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/ds200/grading/","section":"courses","summary":"Grading Weights The final grade for this course depends upon the grades and scores earned on course components weighted as follows:\n 24%: 8 equally weighted in-class labs - 4% for each lab. 20%: 5 equally weighted homework assignments – 4% for each assignment. 25%: 2 midterm exams - 10% for lower grade, and 15% for higher grade. 2% : Persistence.

For open-ended assignments the code must be easy to run without modification and implement all of the required functionality. Documentation: all functions are commented with appropriate doc strings. For open-ended assignments there is a README file discussing how to run the program and what it is supposed to do. Style: the program exhibits effective modular design. The code does not have unnecessary cut and paste code or magic numbers. Variable and function names are sensibly chosen.  80%:  Functionality: For assignments that have well-specified behavior, the code should implement all of the required functionality. For this grade, it is possible that 10-20% of the functionality may be broken. For open-ended assignments it will be possible to get the code running with modest effort (i.e. it will not be as well documented as in a 5, but it isn’t too hard to intuit how the code works). For these types of assignments all required features must be present, however, some (10-20%) may not be functioning properly or otherwise poorly implemented. Documentation: some functions are missing doc strings. Comments are fairly minimal. Style: some aspects of the design of the program could be improved to reduce cut and paste code. Variable and function names are for the most part well-chosen.  60%:  Functionality: The code should implement almost all of the required features (it is okay if roughly 20% are not implemented). A significant portion, 30-50%, of the code may not work as it is supposed to. Documentation: Docstrings are mostly absent For well-defined assignments the code does not run as it should based on the assignment spec. For open-ended assignments there may not be any indication of how to run the program, and it is not easy for a NINJA to figure out how the code works (a good test is if you have to e-mail someone to ask them how their code runs, they are probably at this level). Style: the program design needs improvement. The code would be a lot cleaner if the author had done a better job thinking through the appropriate functional decomposition. The code has lots of cut and paste and magic numbers. Variable and function names are hard to interpret.  40%:  Functionality: the assignment is incomplete (~50% of the functionality is not implemented). The functionality that is implemented is not 100% correct. Documentation: mostly absent. Style: design is poor. Very little attention has been paid to choosing a sensible functional decomposition. Variable and function names are chosen almost arbitrarily.  20%:  Functionality: only minimal functionality is present. Documentation: little or none. Style: Code is not “readable”. Poor choice of variable and function names.  0%:  nothing turned in.  Notebook Assignments Jupyter notebooks are the files you need to submit for labs and homework assignments.\n100%: Thorough engagement with each section of the reading. Each exercise has either been completed, or you have articulated a well-thought out set of questions for each of the problems you didn't answer. Points will be deducted from 100% for the following reasons:\n Exercises are not filled out (either with a solution or a question) The answer to the exercise does not demonstrate a good faith attempt to complete it.  Writing Writing will be evaluated for clarity, concision, and comprehensiveness. The particular style that you should use will depend on the assignment and your audience. The bottom line is don't cut corners with writing in this class. Your ability to communicate what you have done is just as important as what you have done. Don't make the mistake of spending all of your time writing code, and then rush through the writing parts of the assignment. See below for some stylistic guidance.\n Since the dawn of time, college students have been writing introductions that are too grandiose (and often false). Just get into it; you don't have to zoom in from space (and make stuff up). Write the abstract last and summarize the most important result. The passive voice is a hoax. Please write in the first person (singular or plural). Write in the present tense whenever possible. Some actions happen in the past, but all research exists in an eternal present: \u0026ldquo;Using data from BRFSS, they plot weight versus height and find that tall respondents are heavier, on average, than shorter respondents. Our results are consistent with this conclusion.\u0026rdquo; When you edit, try to remove words. Avoid using \u0026ldquo;significant\u0026rdquo; unless you mean \u0026ldquo;statistically significant;\u0026rdquo; a good alternative is \u0026ldquo;substantial.\u0026rdquo; Avoid using \u0026ldquo;correlation\u0026rdquo; unless you mean a coefficient of correlation. In general, there might be a \u0026ldquo;relationship\u0026rdquo; between variables and you might characterize it with a correlation. \u0026ldquo;Trend\u0026rdquo; usually means something is changing in time; \u0026ldquo;pattern\u0026rdquo; is more general. Provide indicators of logical flow. If I ask you to answer a set of question in your report, don't just paste the questions as your section headings. You should create your own document structure based on what makes sense for your project. Explain your motivation. Avoid \u0026ldquo;We were interested\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;We wanted\u0026rdquo; as pseudo-motivation. And don't look at the camera; that is, don't use \u0026ldquo;because we were told to\u0026rdquo; as motivation, and avoid \u0026ldquo;for this project\u0026rdquo;. When you refer to figures and tables, capitalize \u0026ldquo;Figure\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Table.\u0026rdquo; Formal figures have a number and a caption, and they can float. Informal figures are part of the text flow. If a figure doesn't contain much information, summarize it in text. Find an authorial voice that is casual enough to be engaging (without overdoing it).

As a result, a programmable interface that facilitates user–administrator communication in a time-efficient manner is highly demanded.

Our experiment results show that user intent in FLowell can be responded and serviced within 1 s.

Consequently, NFV would facilitate versatile and dynamic network measurement services to meet the increasingly diversified measurement demands. However, it is challenging to provision the measurement services in a virtualized environment due to the stochastic nature in measurement demand and the special requirements of measurement functions such as location constraint and execution time. In this paper, we compose a measurement service chain as a Virtual Measurement Function (VMF) graph, and then propose a dynamic VMF scheduling algorithm for a software-oriented measurement system using Lyapunov optimization technique to maximize the revenue of the system while guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS). The scheduling algorithm decides whether to accept a measurement service request and which measurement nodes (MNs) instantiate the VMF graph. Finally, the performance of our proposed algorithm is verified through theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can increase the total avenue by up to 10%, reduce the service average queue delay by 24%, and decrease the service reject rate by up to 10%, comparing with a heuristic algorithm.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic Virtual Measurement Function scheduling in software-oriented measurement environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peilong Li","Xiaoban Wu","Yongyi Ran","Yan Luo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1495065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495065600,"objectID":"5355e7810ace8c8345eedf52ce61249f","permalink":"https://Peilong.github.io/publication/2017-ancs/","publishdate":"2017-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-ancs/","section":"publication","summary":"Network function virtualization (NFV) introduces great flexibility in designing software-based network appliances to reduce cost and accelerate service deployment for network operators.

The experiment results show that the auto-configured GPU kernels achieve scalable lookup and classification speeds: the prototype system can reach up to 580 Gbps for IP lookups (64-byte packets) and 60 million classifications per second for 4k firewall rules, respectively.","tags":null,"title":"P4GPU: Accelerate packet processing of a P4 program with a CPU-GPU heterogeneous architecture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoban Wu","Peilong Li","Yongyi Ran","Yan Luo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1452384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1452384000,"objectID":"99a5378a2f8778a3f3c13cded0b21258","permalink":"https://Peilong.github.io/publication/2017-fgcs/","publishdate":"2016-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-fgcs/","section":"publication","summary":"Network measurement has been playing a crucial role in network operations, since it cannot only detect the anomalies, but also facilitate traffic engineering. With the fast development of high speed network of 100 Gbps and beyond, how to efficiently monitor and measure the network at flow granularity has become a challenging problem. Although there are dedicated network instrumentation appliances, the flexibility of defining measurement network tasks on a programmable platform is very attractive. In this study, we mainly focus on the evaluation of sketch-based network measurement using a multicore platform supported by Intel DPDK, a fast packet I/O library. We describe the versatile system level design options available for implementing such a programmable measurement platform for 100 GbE network links. Through extensive experiments, we investigate these design options and compare their trade-offs. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of the sketch-based measurement in terms of packet drop rate, processing time per packet and delay per packet. Based on the evaluation over the collected data, we propose the best practical measurement implementation to sustain the line rate while achieving the highest level of programmability.","tags":null,"title":"Network measurement for 100 GbE network links using multicore processors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peilong Li","Yan Luo","Jun Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451520000,"objectID":"5882fd92b34ed10a0b6f44b0751f2977","permalink":"https://Peilong.github.io/publication/2015-jpdc-transformer/","publishdate":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-jpdc-transformer/","section":"publication","summary":"Heterogeneous architectures face challenges regarding transparent acceleration as well as the allocation of resources to cores and accelerators. The “Transformer”, a run-time reprogrammable, heterogeneous architecture consisting of cores and reconfigurable logic with support for coarse-grained acceleration of the dynamic, unpredictable workloads present in mobile and cloud computing environments, is proposed as a solution. The architecture allows for the run-time instantiation of one or more acceleration functions, present in an on-chip reconfigurable logic, which responds to the demands of compute-intensive software libraries. The hardware controller and software wrapper functions are designed to profile workloads, reprogram the internal logic, and invoke the appropriate acceleration functions. Novel heuristics are derived with respect to the accelerator function scheduling. In order to optimize performance and power efficiency, the appropriate system parameters are explored, including the L1 and L2 cache sizes, the accelerator local buffer sizes, as well as the allocation of resources to the cores and accelerators. The simulation results indicate that the Transformer provides significant improvements in terms of performance, up to 14 for single-type workloads and 2.3 for dynamic workloads, as well as energy efficiency, up to 6.9 for various workloads.","tags":null,"title":"Transformer: Run-time reprogrammable heterogeneous architecture for transparent acceleration of dynamic workloads","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peilong Li","Yan Luo","Ning Zhang","Yu Cao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438819200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438819200,"objectID":"225dd449d6c313c5f319d530a6ab731e","permalink":"https://Peilong.github.io/publication/2015-nas-heterospark/","publishdate":"2015-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-nas-heterospark/","section":"publication","summary":"Analytics algorithms on big data sets require tremendous computational capabilities. Spark is a recent development that addresses big data challenges with data and computation distribution and in-memory caching. However, as a CPU only framework, Spark cannot leverage GPUs and a growing set of GPU libraries to achieve better performance and energy efficiency. We present HeteroSpark, a GPU-accelerated heterogeneous architecture integrated with Spark, which combines the massive compute power of GPUs and scalability of CPUs and system memory resources for applications that are both data and compute intensive. We make the following contributions in this work: (1) we integrate the GPU accelerator into current Spark framework to further leverage data parallelism and achieve algorithm acceleration; (2) we provide a plug-n-play design by augmenting Spark platform so that current Spark applications can choose to enable/disable GPU acceleration; (3) application acceleration is transparent to developers, therefore existing Spark applications can be easily ported to this heterogeneous platform without code modifications. The evaluation of HeteroSpark demonstrates up to 18× speedup on a number of machine learning applications.","tags":null,"title":"HeteroSpark: A heterogeneous CPU/GPU Spark platform for machine learning algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wencang Zhao","Junbo Zhang","Peilong Li","Yang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1277164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1277164800,"objectID":"a11a342bdfb15f1b7d5687624d2b00fa","permalink":"https://Peilong.github.io/publication/2010-icicci/","publishdate":"2010-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010-icicci/","section":"publication","summary":"As a crucial procedure in which images are divided into distinct non-overlapping regions and the interested objects are extracted in the process of image analyzing and image recognizing, image segmentation plays a considerable role in extracting medical lesions, measuring specific tissues, and realizing three-dimensional reconstruction. In this paper, integrated with the studies of dental micro-CT images, an image segmentation algorithm based on textural features and neural network is presented to be applied in separating the targeted images from background. By textural-property analysis, the algorithm makes it possible for obtaining image characteristic parameter, which serves as input vector for neural network to extract characteristic information from targeted areas. It is presented in experiments that a relatively better segmentation effect can be expected to improve the accuracy and accelerate segmenting speed.","tags":null,"title":"Study of Image Segmentation Algorithm Based on Textural Features and Neural Network","type":"publication"}]
