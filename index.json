Data science is an interdisciplinary field that applies computer science and statistics to extract useful knowledge from data collected in an almost unlimited range of other disciplines, including business, biology, physics, medicine, meteorology, and many others. In this course, students will apply the popular Python data science toolset to implement analytical models with k-nearest neighbors, regression, decision trees, and clustering, etc., and infer knowledge from real-world data.\nStudent Learning Outcomes  (Introduction) Understand the background and rationale behind this new data science discipline. (Hacking) Proficiently use the Python data science toolset including Jupyter notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn etc., in the lab assignments and projects. (Visualization) Use data visualization python packages Matplotlib and Seaborn to present analytical results. (Statistics) Reinforce the understanding of statistics and its application in the scope of data science. (Analytics) Apply data analytical models including regression, clustering and decision trees to solve data science problems.  Policy Statements Grading Policies The final grade for this course depends upon the grades and scores earned on course components weighted as follows:\n 32% Labs: 8 equally weighted in-class labs \u0026ndash; 4% for each lab. 20% Homework: 5 equally weighted homework assignments – 4% for each assignment. 25%\t2 midterm exams: 10% for lower grade, and 15% for higher grade. 8%\tPaper Presentation: peer evaluation (50%), instructor evaluation (50%) 15%\tFinal Project: project proposal (10%). Midterm check (10%). Project demonstration and presentation (40%). Final project report and revised code (40%).  Attendance Policies Attendance is expected of every student at every lecture. Students are responsible for all content covered in class as well as assigned book chapters. Students should come to class with their text books, having read the material to be covered that day. Students who have not prepared for class may be asked to leave.\nExcept in the case of documented emergencies, neither exams nor in-class labs can be made up afterwards. For excused absences, students must arrange to take the exam or do the lab before the normally scheduled time. Arrangements must be made with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the scheduled time.\nStudents are expected to maintain an attitude of respect at all times toward their colleagues, the equipment, and the instructor. Students are expected to refrain from using the computers for non-course related purposes during class time and will be penalized 1% of the final grade for each occurrence. Cell phones and similar devices should be turned off before entering the classroom. Students who use offensive language, misuse computing facilities, or are otherwise disruptive of the classroom will be asked to leave.\nStatement on School Closure In the event that classes do not meet because Elizabethtown College is closed or delayed due to inclement weather or some other emergency, the slides that would have been covered during the missed classes will posted through Piazza group. Students are expected to do the assigned reading, review the slides, and e-mail the instructor with any questions. There will also be an opportunity to ask questions about the material when classes resume.\nIf a scheduled exam or lab is missed, it will normally be made up on the day that classes resume. If the College is closed on a day when a project is due, the project due date will also normally be extended until the day when classes resume. If circumstances render either of these makeup policies unreasonable, the instructor will send an e-mail explaining an alternative makeup opportunity to each student’s Elizabethtown e-mail account.\nHomework Assignments All homework assignments have to be completed individually in this course. Each assignment must be uploaded into Canvas (https://etown.instructure.com/). Assignments must NOT be stored in a public folder. All submissions must follow the provided file name requirements or risk a score of 0.\nTypically, you will have about two weeks to complete each assignment. All assignments will be graded based on the following criteria:\n Correctness: Finding the right answer Formatting:\tDisplaying the right answer according to instructions Style and Documentation: Producing readable code with appropriate comments  Late assignment will lose 2^(n-1) points per day, including weekends and holidays. For example, -1 after 1 day, -2 after 2 days, -4 after 3 days … until 8+ days students will receive 0 score. Under no circumstances should any student disclose their code, or copy the code written by other students or from an outside source. Both students will receive 0 score on the disclosed/copied assignment.\nStatement on Plagiarism Please refer to the Student Handbook for the college’s policy. All projects and assignments must be completed by students individually, without assistance from anyone other than the instructor. Students can discuss the course material with each other at a conceptual level, but each student must do his or her own work. For projects, exams, and all other activities in the course, students are expected to act according to the official policy on academic dishonesty and the highest standards of personal integrity.\nThe first infraction of academic honesty in this course will carry a penalty of a 0 for the project, lab, or exam in question and a reduction of a full letter grade in the final grade. If a second infraction occurs, the students involved will fail the course, and the instructor will seek the maximum penalty possible under the college’s regulations, up to and including expulsion.\nStatement on Disability Elizabethtown College welcomes otherwise qualified students with disabilities to participate in all of its courses, programs, services, and activities.

As a result, a programmable interface that facilitates user–administrator communication in a time-efficient manner is highly demanded.

Consequently, NFV would facilitate versatile and dynamic network measurement services to meet the increasingly diversified measurement demands. However, it is challenging to provision the measurement services in a virtualized environment due to the stochastic nature in measurement demand and the special requirements of measurement functions such as location constraint and execution time. In this paper, we compose a measurement service chain as a Virtual Measurement Function (VMF) graph, and then propose a dynamic VMF scheduling algorithm for a software-oriented measurement system using Lyapunov optimization technique to maximize the revenue of the system while guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS). The scheduling algorithm decides whether to accept a measurement service request and which measurement nodes (MNs) instantiate the VMF graph. Finally, the performance of our proposed algorithm is verified through theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can increase the total avenue by up to 10%, reduce the service average queue delay by 24%, and decrease the service reject rate by up to 10%, comparing with a heuristic algorithm.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic Virtual Measurement Function scheduling in software-oriented measurement environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peilong Li","Xiaoban Wu","Yongyi Ran","Yan Luo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1495065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495065600,"objectID":"5355e7810ace8c8345eedf52ce61249f","permalink":"https://Peilong.github.io/publication/2017-ancs/","publishdate":"2017-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-ancs/","section":"publication","summary":"Network function virtualization (NFV) introduces great flexibility in designing software-based network appliances to reduce cost and accelerate service deployment for network operators.

We first design a toolset that can be used to map a P4 program onto the proposed architecture. We then optimize the GPU kernel designs for “match-action” primitives and present latency-hiding techniques to reduce the overheads of CPU/GPU communication. In addition, load balancing is investigated to maximize the utilization of CPU and GPU resources.

P4 has been mapped to a wide range of forwarding devices including NPUs, programmable NICs and FPGAs, except for General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) which is a salient parallel architecture for processing network flows. In this work, we design a heterogeneous architecture with both CPU and GPU as a P4 programming target, and present a toolset to map a P4 program onto the proposed architecture. Our evaluation reveals that a P4 program can render promising performance on such architecture by parallelizing its “match+action” engine with the GPGPU accelerator.

With the fast development of high speed network of 100 Gbps and beyond, how to efficiently monitor and measure the network at flow granularity has become a challenging problem. Although there are dedicated network instrumentation appliances, the flexibility of defining measurement network tasks on a programmable platform is very attractive. In this study, we mainly focus on the evaluation of sketch-based network measurement using a multicore platform supported by Intel DPDK, a fast packet I/O library. We describe the versatile system level design options available for implementing such a programmable measurement platform for 100 GbE network links. Through extensive experiments, we investigate these design options and compare their trade-offs. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of the sketch-based measurement in terms of packet drop rate, processing time per packet and delay per packet. Based on the evaluation over the collected data, we propose the best practical measurement implementation to sustain the line rate while achieving the highest level of programmability.","tags":null,"title":"Network measurement for 100 GbE network links using multicore processors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peilong Li","Yan Luo","Jun Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451520000,"objectID":"5882fd92b34ed10a0b6f44b0751f2977","permalink":"https://Peilong.github.io/publication/2015-jpdc-transformer/","publishdate":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-jpdc-transformer/","section":"publication","summary":"Heterogeneous architectures face challenges regarding transparent acceleration as well as the allocation of resources to cores and accelerators. The “Transformer”, a run-time reprogrammable, heterogeneous architecture consisting of cores and reconfigurable logic with support for coarse-grained acceleration of the dynamic, unpredictable workloads present in mobile and cloud computing environments, is proposed as a solution. The architecture allows for the run-time instantiation of one or more acceleration functions, present in an on-chip reconfigurable logic, which responds to the demands of compute-intensive software libraries. The hardware controller and software wrapper functions are designed to profile workloads, reprogram the internal logic, and invoke the appropriate acceleration functions. Novel heuristics are derived with respect to the accelerator function scheduling. In order to optimize performance and power efficiency, the appropriate system parameters are explored, including the L1 and L2 cache sizes, the accelerator local buffer sizes, as well as the allocation of resources to the cores and accelerators. The simulation results indicate that the Transformer provides significant improvements in terms of performance, up to 14 for single-type workloads and 2.3 for dynamic workloads, as well as energy efficiency, up to 6.9 for various workloads.","tags":null,"title":"Transformer: Run-time reprogrammable heterogeneous architecture for transparent acceleration of dynamic workloads","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peilong Li","Yan Luo","Ning Zhang","Yu Cao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438819200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438819200,"objectID":"225dd449d6c313c5f319d530a6ab731e","permalink":"https://Peilong.github.io/publication/2015-nas-heterospark/","publishdate":"2015-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-nas-heterospark/","section":"publication","summary":"Analytics algorithms on big data sets require tremendous computational capabilities. Spark is a recent development that addresses big data challenges with data and computation distribution and in-memory caching. However, as a CPU only framework, Spark cannot leverage GPUs and a growing set of GPU libraries to achieve better performance and energy efficiency. We present HeteroSpark, a GPU-accelerated heterogeneous architecture integrated with Spark, which combines the massive compute power of GPUs and scalability of CPUs and system memory resources for applications that are both data and compute intensive. We make the following contributions in this work: (1) we integrate the GPU accelerator into current Spark framework to further leverage data parallelism and achieve algorithm acceleration; (2) we provide a plug-n-play design by augmenting Spark platform so that current Spark applications can choose to enable/disable GPU acceleration; (3) application acceleration is transparent to developers, therefore existing Spark applications can be easily ported to this heterogeneous platform without code modifications. The evaluation of HeteroSpark demonstrates up to 18× speedup on a number of machine learning applications.","tags":null,"title":"HeteroSpark: A heterogeneous CPU/GPU Spark platform for machine learning algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wencang Zhao","Junbo Zhang","Peilong Li","Yang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1277164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1277164800,"objectID":"a11a342bdfb15f1b7d5687624d2b00fa","permalink":"https://Peilong.github.io/publication/2010-icicci/","publishdate":"2010-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010-icicci/","section":"publication","summary":"As a crucial procedure in which images are divided into distinct non-overlapping regions and the interested objects are extracted in the process of image analyzing and image recognizing, image segmentation plays a considerable role in extracting medical lesions, measuring specific tissues, and realizing three-dimensional reconstruction. In this paper, integrated with the studies of dental micro-CT images, an image segmentation algorithm based on textural features and neural network is presented to be applied in separating the targeted images from background. By textural-property analysis, the algorithm makes it possible for obtaining image characteristic parameter, which serves as input vector for neural network to extract characteristic information from targeted areas. It is presented in experiments that a relatively better segmentation effect can be expected to improve the accuracy and accelerate segmenting speed.","tags":null,"title":"Study of Image Segmentation Algorithm Based on Textural Features and Neural Network","type":"publication"}]
